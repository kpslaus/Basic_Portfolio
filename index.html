				I'm Kyla. I'm 22. I've been told I look like Lavender from the movie Matilda. It used to make me very mad, but than I realized it was better than looking like, for example, Sloth from "The Goonies".

				I live in West Orange with both the folks and I work at a restaurant as a hostess. That's code for "people can walk all over me and I must grit my teeth and swallow my pride otherwise I'll lose my job."
		
				I love to write, and because I love to write, I love to read. I's the greatest thing since the invention of Eggo Waffles. My favorite writers are Truman Capote, Roald Dahl, James Baldwin, and Jeffrey Eugenides. I love Capote especially because his diction is so immaculate. He could describe a leaf on a tree and it will bring me to tears. I love books so much. I love when books look read, meaning they look a little tattered. It means they've been places. Anyone who says they don't read must be an extremely unfulfilled human being. I have always been on the shy side. This has been a challenge, especially in film school, where you're bred to believe you need to be "domineering" "assertive" "loud" and "cocky". Being "shy" has helped me develop other ways to get the job done, without mimicking the personality of a pompous extrovert.
